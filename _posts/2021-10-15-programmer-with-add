# Can I be a Programmer if I Have ADD?
Earlier this year, my boss asked me for the simplest thing he could ask for: write up a bulleted list explaining exactly a developer would need to do to migrate a Drupal 8 site to Drupal 9. 

It took 3 weeks and multiple rounds of revisions for me to finally get something approved. By the time I posted it to our wiki, teams has already gone live with D9 using information they had to get independently.

This was not a case of my boss being a stickler and not being satisfied with my effort. It was part of a pattern that's been going on in my life for as long as I can remember, but one I never wanted to face until this final straw. All the classics were always there: being "smart" but unmotivated, turning in half-assed work (like whatever I was trying to pass off as a D9 upgrade checklist). There are times when I've say with programming problems for 10 hours straight. I can develop through highly detailed plans in my head and explain them thoroughly and understandably to people. With the right combination of timing, inspiration, and a little luck, I can create art. Unfortunately, it's hard to get those ingredients to coalesce consistently. As a result, what I'm left with is work done while bored or distracted that fluctuates in quality to such an extent that it's hard for me to really be reliable.
